## Overview

The Samsung Pay Membership API lets you connect your business to millions of Samsung Pay users by integrating your loyalty programs, gift cards, and other offers with the Samsung Pay app. You can engage with your customers anytime through location-based notifications, real-time updates, and messaging.

Samsung Pay users can view and use their loyalty cards on any Samsung Pay enabled device that has access to the internet. Specifically, the API allows users to add a loyalty program to their digital wallets. When they make a purchase, they can easily share their loyalty info by showing the bar code on their phone or automatically sending it via Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST). They can also use the Samsung Pay app to track their activities, rewards, and loyalty status.

By integrating the **Save to Samsung Pay** button into your website, mobile app, or email messages, you can make it easy for your customers to save your loyalty programs, offers, and gift cards to Samsung Pay.
