The Samsung Pay Membership API lets you connect your business to millions of Samsung Pay users by integrating your membership programs, gift cards, and other offers with the Samsung Pay app. You can engage with your customers anytime through location-based notifications, real-time updates, and messaging.

Samsung Pay users can view and use their membership cards on any Samsung Pay enabled device that has access to the internet. Specifically, the API allows users to add a membership program to their digital wallets. When they make a purchase, they can easily share their membership info by showing the bar code on their phone or automatically sending it via Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST). They can also use the Samsung Pay app to track their activities, rewards, and membership status.

By integrating the **Save to Samsung Pay** button into your website, mobile app, or email messages, you can make it easy for your customers to save your membership programs, offers, and gift cards to Samsung Pay.
