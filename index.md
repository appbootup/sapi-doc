# Membership Samsung API

Membership Samsung API (MS_API) is enabling merchants to easily integrate Save to Samsung Pay service (S2P) into websites.

## Components
* **Open SDKs:** MS_API provides two SDK libraries for each merchant to use to integrate S2P service. Libraries includes a JavaScript lib (`s2p.js`) for client-side and a merchant preferred language based server-side lib (i.e., if merchant's server is implemented in Java, then a s2p.jar will be provided).
* **Membership Samsung API:** MS_API is handling requests that sending from merchant websites and will provide proper response to allow users to finish the Save to Samsung Pay procedures. As a merchant, integrating S2P, the entire communications between client-side SDK and MS_API are happening underneath. The extensive documentation about MS_API can be found in the following section.

## Open SDK API documentation
Even though merchants are able to integrate S2P service by using MS_API SDKs without acknowledging actual communications between SDKs and S2P API server, we still believe that provide an accurate and transparent API documentation is a MUST.
The API documentation can be found [Membership Samsung API]().
