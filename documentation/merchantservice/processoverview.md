## Integration Process Overview
---

The integration process includes the following steps:

  1. A partner contacts a Samsung Relationship Manager to get Samsung Pay API credentials for accessing the API.

  2. The partner uses the technical information including the process details, API documentation, and UI guidelines provided by this website to complete the integration with Samsung Pay wallet.

  3. After completing the registration, the partner reviews the solution with the Samsung Relationship Manager to ensure UX and brand guidelines/allstandards have been met.

  4. Finally, the merchant app/website is made public for users through distribution channels as applicable.
